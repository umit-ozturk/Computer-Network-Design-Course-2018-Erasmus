**Work**

On Linux there is a command called netcat which can function either as client or as server, using either TCP or UDP protocols. Open a SSH connection to the Linux test server and identify the manual page for the netcat command. Compose the proper command which sends a UDP packet to port 12345 of your Windows workstation.
Note: port 12345 is special in the network laboratory workstations because it is treated as an exception in Windows firewall configuration.
